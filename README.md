# Financial Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains a financial analysis dashboard visualizing key financial performance indicators (KPIs) and profit breakdowns. The dashboard offers interactive exploration through year and month filters, providing insights into sales, orders, profit, and discount trends.

## Key Highlights       

* **Strong Growth:** Significant year-over-year growth is observed in sales, orders, and profit.  (Specific percentages available in the dashboard).
* **Increased Discounts:** A substantial rise in discounts correlates with the growth, suggesting a potential strategic focus on discounting.
* **Profit Margin Impact:** While profit has increased, the profit margin has seen a slight decrease, potentially due to the increased discounting.
* **Key Performers:**
    * **Products:**  Paseo, VTT, and Velo are identified as top-selling products.
    * **Segment:** Channel Partners contribute the highest percentage of profit.
    * **Region:**  The United States (and North America overall) shows the highest number of orders and substantial profit contribution, followed by Canada and France.
* **Detailed Profit Breakdown:** The included table provides granular profit data by country, product, customer segment (Channel Partners), and discount band, enabling in-depth analysis of profitability drivers.
* **Year-over-Year Comparison:**  The dashboard and table facilitate comparisons of current profit with the previous year's profit (Profit LY) for detailed insights into profit growth or decline in specific areas.
