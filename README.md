## Key Highlights

* **Strong Growth:** Significant year-over-year growth is observed in sales, orders, and profit.  (Specific percentages available in the dashboard).
* **Increased Discounts:** A substantial rise in discounts correlates with the growth, suggesting a potential strategic focus on discounting.
* **Profit Margin Impact:** While profit has increased, the profit margin has seen a slight decrease, potentially due to the increased discounting.
* **Key Performers:**
    * **Products:**  Paseo, VTT, and Velo are identified as top-selling products.

    * **Region:**  The United States (and North America overall) shows the highest number of orders and substantial profit contribution, followed by Canada and France.
